# Snake Game in Pygame

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. The player controls a snake, aiming to eat food that randomly spawns on the screen. Each piece of food eaten increases the snake's length. The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). You also need Pygame installed, which can be done using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
3. Run the game using Python:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

Replace `snake_game.py` with the path to the game script if it is different.

## Controls
- **Arrow Up**: Move the snake up.
- **Arrow Down**: Move the snake down.
- **Arrow Left**: Move the snake left.
- **Arrow Right**: Move the snake right.

The game continues until the snake runs into itself or the edges of the window.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
- Randomized food placement.
